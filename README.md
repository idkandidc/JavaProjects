# JavaProjects

For the jar files to run correctly, the images must be in the same folder as the jar file so that they show up in the program.
All prjects run in Java.
All codes are in the folders of their project sorted as would happen with an eclipse compiler.
To find codes for a project look in the "src" and "main" folders for each project.
