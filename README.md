# JavaProjects

For the jar files to run correctly, the images must be in the same folder as the jar file so that they show up in the program.
All prjects run in Java.
All codes are in the folders of their project sorted by default settings of an eclipse compiler.
Codes can be found in the "src" folder of the project.
